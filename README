 Linux:
 -Read the xv6 book to inderstand filesystem structure
 -Wrote functions to easily access the superblock, any inode, or any bit in the
  bitmap
 -One by one, filled out functions, one for each of the 12 tests
 -One type of function looped over the inodes and performed checks, perhaps 
  caching file reference counts or checking the bitmap
 -The other type of funciton looped over the directories and checked for 
  correct things
  
  xv6:
  -Added user programs hello and asd for testing
  -Added SMALLFILE cases to sys_open in sysfile.c
  -Added SMALLFILE_SIZE to fs.h
  -Added T_SMALLFILE to stat.h
  -Added O_SMALLFILE to fcntl.h
  -Changed readi in fs.c to have a SMALLFILE case
  -Changed readi so it reads single bytes in the inode addrs array 
  -Changed writei in fs.c to have a SMALLFILE case
  -Changed writei so it write to single bytes in the inode addrs array
